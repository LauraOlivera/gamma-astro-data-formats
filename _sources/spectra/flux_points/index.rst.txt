SED
===

The SED format is a flexible specification for representing
one-dimensional spectra (distributions of amplitude vs. energy).  The
SED is structured as a table with one row per energy bin/point and
columns for the energy, measured normalization, and normalization
errors.  The format supports both integral and differential
representations of the normalization as described in
:ref:`norm_representations`.

The list of supported columns is given in the :ref:`sed_columns` section.
All columns are optional by default, and an SED may contain any
combination of the allowed columns.  :ref:`sed_types` are a
specification for defining groups of columns that are required to be
present in the file.  The :ref:`likelihood_sed` format is an example
of an SED type that contains both measured flux points and the profile
likelihoods versus normalization in each energy bin.

The SED format does not enforce a specific set of units but units
should be defined in the column metadata for all quantities with
physical dimensions.  Recommended units are provided in the
:ref:`sed_columns` section to indicate the dimensionality of each
column.  Column UCDs are intended for defining the type of physical
quantity associated to each column (e.g. energy, photon flux, etc.).
The convention for including UCDs in the column metdata is still under
discussion and the UCDs defined in the current format are optional.

The intended serialization format is a FITS BINTABLE with one row per
energy bin.  However any serialization format that supports tabular
data and column metadata could also be supported (e.g. ECSV or HDF5).
Because the SED occupies a single HDU multiple SEDs can be written to
a single FITS file with an identifier (e.g. source name or observation
epoch) used as the HDU name.  Sample FITS and ECSV files are provided
in :ref:`sed_sample_files`.

.. _norm_representations:

Normalization Representation
----------------------------

The SED format supports both differential and integral representations
of the source normalization.  Integral representations correspond to
quantities integrated over an energy bin as defined by the ``e_min``
and ``e_max`` columns.  Differential representations are quantities
evaluated at a discrete energies defined by the ``e_ref`` column.  The
supported :ref:`norm_columns` are:

* ``dnde`` : Differential photon flux at ``e_ref``.
  Dimensionality: photons / (time * area * energy)
* ``e2dnde`` : Defined as ``(e_ref ^ 2) * dnde``.
  A commonly published and plotted differential flux quantity.
  Dimensionality: energy / (time * area)
* ``rate`` : Photon rate between ``e_min`` and ``e_max``.
  Dimensionality: photons / time.
* ``flux`` : Photon flux (integral of ``dnde``) between ``e_min`` and
  ``e_max``. Dimensionality: photons / ( time * area )
* ``eflux`` : Energy flux (integral of E times ``dnde``) between
  ``e_min`` and ``e_max``. Dimensionality: energy / ( time * area )
* ``npred`` : Photon counts between ``e_min`` and ``e_max``.
  Dimensionality: photons
* ``norm`` : Normalization in units of the reference model.
  Dimensionality: unitless

An SED should contain at least one of the normalization
representations listed above.  Multiple representations (e.g. ``flux``
and ``dnde``) may be included in a single SED.

The ``dnde`` and ``e2dnde`` representations are equivalent. We define
both here, because both are in common use for publications and plots.

Errors and upper limits on the normalization are defined with the
:ref:`error_columns` by appending the appropriate suffix to the
normalization column name.  For example in the case of photon flux the
error and upper limit columns are:

* ``flux_err`` : Symmetric 1-sigma error.
* ``flux_errp`` : Asymmtric 1-sigma positive error.
* ``flux_errn`` : Asymmtric 1-sigma negative error.
* ``flux_ul`` : Upper limit with confidence level given by ``UL_CONF``
  header keyword.

A row may have a value and any combination of upper limits and errors:

.. code-block:: none

   e_ref dnde dnde_err dnde_errp dnde_errn dnde_ul
   1000.0 1.0 0.1 0.1 0.1 1.16
   3000.0 1.0 0.1 0.1 0.1 1.16

A ``nan`` value should be used for empty or missing data such as a bin
for which there is an upper limit but no value and vice versa, e.g.

.. code-block:: none

   e_ref dnde dnde_err dnde_ul
   1000.0 1.0 0.1 nan
   3000.0 nan nan 1.16
   
The ``is_ul`` column is an optional boolean flag that can be used to
designate whether the measurement in a given row should be interpreted
as a two-sided confidence interval or an upper limit:

.. code-block:: none

   e_ref dnde dnde_err dnde_ul is_ul
   1000.0 1.0 0.1 nan False
   3000.0 nan nan 1.16 True

Setting UL values to ``nan`` is an implicit way of flagging rows that
do not contain an upper limit.  When parsing an SED one should first
check for the existence of the ``is_ul`` column and otherwise check
for ``nan`` values in the UL column.  The ``is_ul`` column is only
required if you want to explicitly flag ULs when both the UL and
two-sided interval may be defined in a row.
   
.. _ref_model:

Reference Model
---------------

The *reference model* of an SED is the global parameterization that
was used to extract the normalization in each energy bin.  The choice
of reference model is relevant when considering models that
are rapidly changing across a bin or when energy dispersion is large
relative to the bin size.  The :ref:`refmodel_columns` define the
reference model in different representations.  When an SED includes a
reference model, the normalizations, errors, and upper limits can be
given in the ``norm`` representation which is expressed in units of
the reference model.  ``norm`` columns can be converted to another
representation by performing an element-wise multiplication of the
column with the ``ref`` column of the desired representation.

.. _likelihood:

Likelihood Profiles
-------------------

The :ref:`like_columns` contain values of the model likelihood and
likelihood profiles versus normalization.  Likelihood profiles provide
additional information about the measurement uncertainty in each bin.
A more detailed discussion of the motivation for SED likelihood
profiles can be found in :ref:`likelihood_sed`.

.. _sed_types:

SED Types
---------

By default all columns in the SED format are optional.  To facilitate
interoperability of files produced by different packages/tools, the
SED format defines an *SED Type* string which is set with the
``SED_TYPE`` header keyword.  The SED type defines a minimal set of
columns that must be present in the SED.  The SED types and their
required columns are given in the following list:

* ``dnde``: ``e_ref``, ``dnde``
* ``e2dnde``: ``e_ref``, ``e2dnde``
* ``flux``: ``e_min``, ``e_max``, ``flux``
* ``eflux``: ``e_min``, ``e_max``, ``eflux``
* ``likelihood``: See :ref:`likelihood_sed`.
