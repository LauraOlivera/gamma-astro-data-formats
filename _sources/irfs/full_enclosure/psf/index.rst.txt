PSF format
==========

IACTs PSF does not always have a Gaussian shape. Its shape is highly dependent 
on the analysis and each specific instrument. For this reason, several parameterizations are
allowed to store the PSF:

.. toctree::

   psf_table/index
   psf_3gauss/index
   psf_king/index
   psf_gtpsf/index
