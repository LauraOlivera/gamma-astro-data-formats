Point-like IRFs
===============

Point-like IRFs has been classically used within the IACT community. Each IRF component is calculated from the
events surviving an energy dependent directional cut around the assumed source position.

The format of each point-like IRF component is analog to the ones already described within the full enclosure
IRF specifications (see :ref:`full-enclosure-irfs`), with certain differences listed in this section.

Any point-like IRF component should contain the header keyword:

* ``HDUCLAS3 = POINT-LIKE``

.. _rad_max:

RAD_MAX
+++++++

In addition to the IRFs, the actual directional cut applied to the data needs to be stored. This cut is allowed
to be constant or variable along several axes, with a different format.

In case the angular cut is constant along the energy and FoV, an additional header keyword may be added to the
IRF HDU:

Header keyword:

* ``RAD_MAX`` type: float, unit: deg
    * Radius of the directional cut applied to calculate the IRF, in degrees.

If this keyword is present, the science tools should assume the directional cut of this point-like IRF is constant
over all axes. In case the angular cut is variable along any axis (reconstructed energy or FoV), an additional HDU
is required to store these values. Note any DL3 file with a point-like IRF (with ``HDUCLAS3 = POINT-LIKE``) that
has no ``RAD_MAX`` keyword within the HDU metadata should have this additional HDU.

In case the directional cut is variable with energy or the FoV, point-like IRFs require an additional binary
table. It stores the values of ``RAD_MAX`` as a function of the reconstructed energy and FoV following the
:ref:`fits-arrays-bintable-hdu` format.

.. _rad_max_2d:

RAD_MAX_2D
----------

The ``RAD_MAX_2D`` format contains a 2-dimensional array of directional cut values, stored in the
:ref:`fits-arrays-bintable-hdu` format.

Required columns:

* ``ENERG_LO``, ``ENERG_HI`` -- ndim: 1, unit: TeV
    * Reconstructed energy axis
* ``THETA_LO``, ``THETA_HI`` -- ndim: 1, unit: deg
    * Field of view offset axis
* ``RAD_MAX`` -- ndim: 2, unit: deg
    * Radius of the directional cut applied to calculate the IRF, in degrees.

Recommended axis order: ``ENERGY``, ``THETA``, ``RAD_MAX``

Header keywords:

As explained in :ref:`hduclass`, the following header keyword should be used to
declare the type of HDU:

* ``HDUDOC``   = 'https://github.com/open-gamma-ray-astro/gamma-astro-data-formats'
* ``HDUVERS``  = '0.2'
* ``HDUCLASS`` = 'GADF'
* ``HDUCLAS1`` = 'RESPONSE'
* ``HDUCLAS2`` = 'RAD_MAX'
* ``HDUCLAS3`` = 'POINT-LIKE'
* ``HDUCLAS4`` = 'RAD_MAX_2D'
