Introduction
------------

This page describes how times should be stored.
This is a solved problem, we follow the `FITS standard`_.
However, the FITS standard is very complex (see also `FITS time paper`_),
and allows for different ways to store times in FITS, some of which
are hard to understand and implement.

To keep things simple, we here agree on a way to store times that
is fully compliant, but a subset of the ways allowed by the FITS standard
(see :ref:`time-formats` below).

This has the advantage of simplicity and uniformity for writers and readers
(see :ref:`time-tools` below).

One major point allowing for this simplicity is that we only need single 64-bit float precision for time
in high-level (DL3 and up) gamma-ray astronomy, as explained in the :ref:`time-precision` section below.

At the time of writing this general page on time, the following definitions reference it:

* :ref:`iact-events` has the ``TIME`` column and several times given via header keywords
* :ref:`iact-gti` has the ``START`` and ``STOP`` columns
* :ref:`iact-pnt` has the ``TIME`` column
* :ref:`obs-index` has the ``TSTART`` and ``TSTOP`` columns

* `Time in Fermi data analysis`_

.. _time-formats:

Formats
-------

In tables, times should be given as 64-bit float values. For all the tables and columns mentioned
in the introduction, the times are given as seconds since a reference time point.

The reference time point is specified by the following FITS header keywords:

* ``MJDREFI`` type: int, unit: days
    * Integer part of instrument specific MJD time reference
* ``MJDREFF`` type: float, unit: days
    * Float part of instrument specific MJD time reference
* ``TIMEUNIT`` type: string
    * Time unit (e.g. 's')
* ``TIMESYS`` type: string
    * Time system, also referred as time scale (e.g. 'UT1', 'UTC', 'TT', 'TAI', see Table 30 of the `FITS standard`_)
* ``TIMEREF`` type: string
    * Time reference frame, used for example for barycentric corrections
      (options: 'TOPOCENTER', 'GEOCENTER', 'BARYCENTER', 'HELIOCENTER', and more see Table 31 of the `FITS standard`_)

See the `FITS standard`_ and the `FITS time paper`_ for further information.

For light curves (not specified yet), the use of ``TIMESYS='d'`` in days is also common.

Some existing files don't give ``TIMEUNIT`` and / or ``TIMEREF``. In those cases, science tools
should assume defaults of ``TIMEUNIT='s'`` and ``TIMEREF='LOCAL'``. No defaults exist for
``MJDREFI``, ``MJDREFF`` and ``TIMESYS``, if those are missing science tools should raise an error and exit.
New files should always be written with all five header keys.

In addition to that main way of specifying times as a floating point number wrt. a reference time point,
the following header keys with date and time values as strings can be added.
This is for convenience and humans reading the information. Usually science tools will not access
this redundant and optional information. The time system used should be the one given by ``TIMESYS``.
All values for the keywords mentioned here shall be ISO8601 date and time strings,
``yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS.fff``.
The precision is not fixed, so seconds or fractional seconds could be left out.

* ``DATE-OBS`` type: string
    * Observation date and time, typically the start of observations if not defined otherwise in the comment
* ``DATE-BEG`` type: string
    * Observation start date and time
* ``DATE-AVG`` type: string
    * Average observation date and time
* ``DATE-END`` type: string
    * Observation end date and time

.. _time-tools:

Tools
-----

The `SOFA Time Scale and Calendar Tools`_ document provides a detailed
description of times in the high-precision IAU SOFA library, which is the
gold standard for times in astronomy.
The SOFA time routines are available via the  `Astropy time`_ Python package,
which makes it easy to convert between different **time scales**
(``utc``, ``tt`` and ``mjd`` in this example).

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from astropy.time import Time
    >>> time = Time('2011-01-01 00:00:00', scale='utc', format='iso')
    >>> time
    <Time object: scale='utc' format='iso' value=2011-01-01 00:00:00.000>
    >>> time.tt
    <Time object: scale='tt' format='iso' value=2011-01-01 00:01:06.184>
    >>> time.mjd
    55562.0

as well as different **time formats** (``iso``, ``isot`` and ``fits`` in this example)

.. code-block:: python

    >>> time.iso
    '2011-01-01 00:00:00.000'
    >>> time.isot
    '2011-01-01T00:00:00.000'
    >>> time.fits
    '2011-01-01T00:00:00.000(UTC)'

If you don't want to install SOFA or Astropy (or to double-check),
you can use the `xTime`_ time conversion utility provided by HEASARC as a web tool.

* Gammapy uses `Astropy time`_, with custom utility functions for FITS I/O
  to write in the formats recommended here.
* Gammalib has custom code to hande times that is described in `Times in Gammalib`_.

.. _time-precision:

Precision
---------

Depending on the use case and required precision, times are stored as strings
or as one or several integer or floating point numbers. Tools usually use
one 64-bit or two 64-bit floating point numbers for time calculations.

For high-level gamma-ray astronomy, the situation can be summarised like this
(see sub-section computation below for details):

* **Do use single 64-bit floats for times.**
  The resulting precision will be about 0.1 micro-seconds or better,
  which is sufficient for any high-level analysis (including milli-second pulsars).
* **Do not use 32-bit floats for times.**
  If you do, times will be incorrect at the 1 to 100 second level.
* More than 64-bit floats or a combination of two floating point numbers is not necessary

For data acquisition and low-level analysis (event triggering, traces, ...),
IACTs require nanosecond precision or better. There, the simple advice to use
64-bit floats representing seconds wrt. a single reference time doesn't work!
One either needs to have several reference times (e.g. per-observation) or
two integer or float values. This is not covered by this spec.

The time precision obtained with a single 32-bit or 64-bit float can be computed
with this function:

.. code-block:: python

    def time_precision(time_range, float_precision):
        """Compute time precision (seconds) in float computations.
        
        For a given `time_range` and `float_precision`, the `time_precision`
        is computed as the smallest time difference corresponding to the
        float precision.
        
        time_range -- (IN) Time range of application (years)
        float_precision -- (IN) {32, 64} Floating point precision
        time_precision -- (OUT) Time precision (seconds)    
        """
        import numpy as np
        YEAR_TO_SEC = 315576000
        
        dtype = {32: np.float32, 64: np.float64}[float_precision]
        t1 = dtype(YEAR_TO_SEC * time_range)
        t2 = np.nextafter(t1, np.finfo(dtype).max)
        print('Time range: {} years, float precision: {} bit => time precision: {:.3g} seconds.'
              ''.format(time_range, float_precision, t2-t1))

.. code-block:: python

    >>> time_precision(10, 32)
    Time range: 10 years, float precision: 32 bit => time precision: 256 seconds.
    >>> time_precision(10, 64)
    Time range: 10 years, float precision: 64 bit => time precision: 4.77e-07 seconds.
