.. _coords:

Coordinates
===========

This section describes the sky coordinates in use by science tools. It is
referenced from the description of data formats to explain the exact meaning of
the coordinates stored.

We don't have a separate section for world coordinate systems (WCS), pixel
coordinates, projections, that is covered here as well (see `FITS WCS`_ and
`WCSLIB`_ for references).

We only discuss 2-dimensional sky and image coordinates here, other coordinates
like e.g. time or an energy axis aren't covered here.

Some conventions are adopted from `astropy.coordinates`_,
which is a Python wrapper of the `IAU SOFA`_ C time and coordinate library,
which is the authoritative implementation of the IAU Standards of Fundamental Astronomy.
In some cases code examples are given using `astropy.coordinates` to obtain a reference value that
can be used to check a given software package (in case it's not based on `astropy.coordinates`).

.. _coords-radec:

RA / DEC
--------

The most common way to give sky coordinates is as right ascension (RA) and
declination (DEC) in the `equatorial coordinate system`_.

Actually there are several equatorial coordinate systems in use, the most common
ones being FK4, FK5 and ICRS.
If you're interested to learn more about these and
other astronomical coordinate systems, look into the `Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac`_.

But in practice it's pretty simple: when someone gives or talks about RA / DEC
coordinates, they mean either ICRS or FK5 J2000 coordinates. The difference
between those two is at the sub-arcsecond level for the whole sky, i.e.
irrelevant for gamma-ray astronomy.

We recommend you by default assume RA / DEC is in the ICRS frame, which is the
default in `astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord`_ and also the current standard
celestial reference system adopted by the IAU (see `Wikipedia - ICRS`_).

.. _coords-galactic:

Galactic
--------

The `Galactic coordinate system`_ is often used by Galactic astronomers.

Unfortunately there are slightly different variants in use (usually with differences at the arcsecond level),
and there are no standard names for these slightly different Galactic coordinate frames.
See `here <https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/3344>`__ for an open discussion which Galactic coordinates
to support and what to call them in Astropy.

We recommend you use ICRS RA / DEC for precision coordinate computations. If you do use Galactic coordinates,
we recommend you compute them like Astropy does (which I think is the most frame in use in the literature
and in existing astronomy software).

Both ICRS and Galactic coordinates don't need the specification of an `epoch`_
or `equinox`_.

To check your software, you can use the ``(l, b) = (0, 0)`` position:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
    >>> SkyCoord(0, 0, unit='deg', frame='galactic')
    <SkyCoord (Galactic): (l, b) in deg (0.0, 0.0)>
    >>> SkyCoord(0, 0, unit='deg', frame='galactic').icrs
    <SkyCoord (ICRS): (ra, dec) in deg (266.40498829, -28.93617776)>

.. _coords-altaz:

Alt / Az
--------

The `horizontal coordinate system`_ is the one connected to an observer at a
given location on earth and point in time.

* Azimuth is oriented east of north (i.e. north is at 0 deg, east at 90 deg,
  south at 180 deg and west at 270 deg). This is the convention used by
  `astropy.coordinates.AltAz`_ and quoted as the most common convention in
  astronomy on Wikipedia (see `horizontal coordinate system`_).
* The zenith angle is defined as the angular separation from the `zenith`_,
  which is the direction defined by the line connecting the Earth's center and the observer.
  Altitude and elevation are the same thing, and are defined as 90 degree minus the zenith angle.
  The reason to define altitude like this instead of the angle above the horizon is that usually Earth models
  aren't perfect spheres, but ellipsoids, so the zenith angle as defined here isn't perfectly perpendicular
  with the horizon plane.
* Unless explicitly specified, Alt / Az should be assumed to not include any refraction corrections,
  i.e. be valid assuming no refraction. Usually this can be achived in coordinate codes by setting
  the atmospheric pressure to zero, i.e. turning the atmosphere off.

Here's some Astropy coordinates code that shows how to convert back and forth
between ICRS and AltAz coordinates (the default pressure is set to zero in
Astropy, i.e. this is without refraction corrections):

.. code-block:: python

    import astropy.units as u
    from astropy.time import Time
    from astropy.coordinates import Angle, SkyCoord, EarthLocation, AltAz

    # Take any ICRS sky coordinate
    icrs = SkyCoord.from_name('crab')
    print('RA = {pos.ra.deg:10.5f}, DEC = {pos.dec.deg:10.5f}'.format(pos=icrs))
    # RA =   83.63308, DEC =   22.01450

    # Convert to AltAz for some random observation time and location
    # This assumes pressure is zero, i.e. no refraction
    time = Time('2010-04-26', scale='tt')
    location = EarthLocation(lon=42 * u.deg, lat=42 * u.deg, height=42 * u.meter)
    altaz_frame = AltAz(obstime=time, location=location)
    altaz = icrs.transform_to(altaz_frame)
    print('AZ = {pos.az.deg:10.5f}, ALT = {pos.alt.deg:10.5f}'.format(pos=altaz))
    # AZ =  351.88232, ALT =  -25.56281

    # Convert back to ICRS to make sure round-tripping is OK
    icrs2 = altaz.transform_to('icrs')
    print('RA = {pos.ra.deg:10.5f}, DEC = {pos.dec.deg:10.5f}'.format(pos=icrs2))
    # RA =   83.63308, DEC =   22.01450


.. _coords-fov:

Field of view
-------------

FOV coordinates are currently used in two places in this spec:

1. Some :ref:`background models <bkg>` are in the FOV coordinate system
   and FOV coordinates can also be used for other IRFs.
2. FOV coordinates appear is as optional columns in the :ref:`events <iact-events>` table.
   While it is possible to compute FOV coordinates from the ``RA``, ``DEC``, ``TIME`` columns
   and the observatory :ref:`coords-location`, some IACTs choose to add FOV
   coordinate columns to their event lists for convenience.

In Gamma-ray astronomy, sometimes field of view (FOV) coordinates are used.
The basic idea is to have a coordinate system that is centered on the array
pointing position. We define FOV coordinates here to be spherical coordinates,
there is no projection or WCS, only a spherical rotation.

Two ways to give the spherical coordinate are defined:

1. ``(LON, LAT)`` with the pointing position on the equator at ``(LON, LAT) = (0, 0)``
     * ``LON``: Longitude (range -180 deg to + 180 deg)
     * ``LAT``: Latitude (range -90 deg to + 90 deg)
2. ``(THETA, PHI)`` with the pointing position at the pole ``THETA=0``
     * ``THETA``: Offset angle (range 0 deg to +180 deg)
     * ``PHI``: Position angle (range 0 deg to 360 deg)

Two orientations of the FOV coordinate system are defined:

1. Aligned with the ``ALTAZ`` system
2. Aligned with the ``RADEC`` system

This yields the following possible coordinates:

===============  ==================================
Field            Description
===============  ==================================
FOV_ALTAZ_LON    Longitude in ALTAZ FOV system
FOV_ALTAZ_LAT    Latitude in ALTAZ FOV system
FOV_ALTAZ_THETA  Offset angle in ALTAZ FOV system
FOV_ALTAZ_PHI    Position angle in ALTAZ FOV system
---------------  ----------------------------------
FOV_RADEC_LON    Longitude in RADEC FOV system
FOV_RADEC_LAT    Latitude in RADEC FOV system
FOV_RADEC_THETA  Offset angle in RADEC FOV system
FOV_RADEC_PHI    Position angle in RADEC FOV system
===============  ==================================

* The FOV offset angle (separation to pointing position) ``THETA`` doesn't depend
  on the orientation. So in this spec, often simply ``THETA`` is used,
  and that is equal to ``FOV_ALTAZ_THETA`` and ``FOV_RADEC_THETA``.
* The other FOV coordinates depend on the alignment and orientation of a second
  coordinate systems (``OTHER``, either ``ALTAZ`` or ``RADEC``).

  * FOV PHI is counterclockwise from OTHER north,
    i.e. ``PHI=0 deg`` pointing to OTHER LAT,
    and ``PHI=270 deg`` pointing to OTHER LON
  * FOV LON should increase with decreasing OTHER LON
  * FOV LAT should increase with increasing OTHER LAT

In the :ref:`events <iact-events>` table, the column names ``DETX`` and ``DETY``
are sometimes used. This originates from the `OGIP event list`_ standard,
which uses these names for "detector coordinates". Given that IACTs don't have
a detector chip (or at least the FOV coordinates used in high-level analysis are
different from the IACT camera coordinate detectors), the definition is not unambiguous,
both ``(DETX, DETY) = (FOV_ALTAZ_LON, FOV_ALTAZ_LAT)``
and ``(DETX, DETY) = (FOV_RADEC_LON, FOV_RADEC_LAT)``
have been used.

To resolve this ambiguity, we propose a header key ``FOVALIGN={ALTAZ,RADEC}``,
specifying which definition of field-of-view coordinates is used. If the key is
not present, ``FOVALIGN=ALTAZ`` should be assumed as default.

Given the situation that there is no concensus yet, one suggestion is to avoid putting
FOV coordinates in EVENTS, or if they are added, to clearly state how they are defined.

.. _coords-location:

Earth location
--------------

When working with Alt-Az coordinates or very high-precision times,
an observatory Earth location is needed. However, note that high-level
analysis for most use cases does not need this information.

The `FITS standard`_ specifies two possibilities for defining observatory location:

* ITRS Cartesian coordinates (defined in section 8.4.1, strongly prefered according to section 9.3.2)
* Geodetic latitude / longitude / elevation

For ITRS Cartesian coordinates, use

* ``OBSGEO-X``, ``OBSGEO-Y``, ``OBSGEO-Z`` type: float, unit: m

For geodetic coordinates, use

* ``OBSGEO-L`` Geographic longitude of array center, type: float, unit: deg
* ``OBSGEO-B`` Geographic latitude of array center, type: float, unit: deg  
* ``OBSGEO-H`` Altitude of array center above WGS84 reference ellipsoid, type: float, unit: m  


.. note::
    Up to including version 0.2 of this standard, 
    the keywords ``GEOLON``, ``GEOLAT`` and ``ALTITUDE`` were used for
    the observatory location.
  

While it is possible in principle to change this for each FITS file,
in practice the observatory or telescope array center position is something
that is chosen once and then used consistently in the event reconstruction
and analysis. As an example, H.E.S.S. uses the following location and
FITS header keys::

  OBSGEO-B = -23.2717777777778 / latitude of observatory (deg)
  OBSGEO-L =  16.5002222222222 / longitude of observatory (deg)
  OBSGEO-H =             1835. / altitude of observatory (m)
